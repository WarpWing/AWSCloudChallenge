# Captain's Log: Day 1 (October 26th 2020)
All is going well with setting up the website. I have not finished the AWS CCP Certificate but I have a AWS Educate Account that I can use to start this project and get the Certificate midway through. I have set up a index.html and plan to go through the entire project list. Althought the chance for a Job Offer is way past overdue, I'll still do this challenge for the thrill of experience new things. I plan to use the basic core AWS Services and use Terraform for Provisoning Infrastructure instead of Amazon's SAM framework. No problems yet but I'll make sure to record them all here. Exciting plans are in motion for the future of this website.
